# TAU Platform: Initial Standards & Alignment

**Category:** Announcements

---

The TAU (Tailored Agentic Units) Platform is a composable Go library ecosystem for building agentic applications. Rather than building monolithic applications, we build applications from focused, reusable libraries with clean interfaces.

Over the course of our initial conversations, we've covered a lot of ground -- ecosystem vision, library extraction roadmap, naming conventions, architecture patterns, development philosophy, and tooling strategy. Those discussions produced valuable artifacts (see `archive/` in this repo), but the details are scattered across documents and conversations.

This discussion series organizes those details into focused, reviewable topics and establishes the foundational standards for how we build, coordinate, and evolve this ecosystem. Each topic below has its own dedicated discussion for focused conversation and resolution.

## Standards Lifecycle

Every standard follows this lifecycle:

```
Draft --> Discuss --> Formalize --> Operationalize
```

1. **Draft** -- Content is written in this repository's `drafts/` directory
2. **Discuss** -- Published as a GitHub Discussion for team review and iteration
3. **Formalize** -- Resolved decisions are captured in `standards/` documents
4. **Operationalize** -- Standards are encoded as Claude Code skills for AI-assisted development

## Topic Discussions

<!-- Links will be added after topic discussions are published -->

1. **Ontology: Common Vocabulary for the TAU Platform** -- Establishes shared terminology across all repositories and team communication
2. **Project Management: Infrastructure & Processes** -- Describes the GitHub Projects v2 infrastructure, phase-based tracking, and cross-repo coordination
3. **Iterative Development: A Kaizen Approach to Architecture** -- Defines our development philosophy: build incrementally, introduce complexity when needed
4. **Web Service Architecture: Go + Fiber Standards** -- Establishes patterns for web service development, mapped from proven implementations
5. **Claude Code Skills: AI-Assisted Development Standards** -- Documents how we use Claude Code skills to encode standards and accelerate development

## How to Participate

- Review each topic discussion and share your perspective
- Propose modifications or additions as comments
- Flag terms, patterns, or decisions that need clarification
- Once a topic reaches consensus, we'll formalize it into a standard

These discussions are the foundation for everything we build. Take the time to engage with each topic -- alignment now prevents friction later.
